Code of Conduct
---------------

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
`psyplot Code of Conduct <https://github.com/psyplot/psyplot/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`__.
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

What should I know before I get started?
----------------------------------------

The psyplot framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``psyplot`` is just the framework that allows interactive data analysis
and visualization. Much of the functionality however is implemented by
other packages. What package is the correct one for your bug
report/feature request, can be determined by the following list

-  `psyplot-gui <https://github.com/psyplot/psyplot-gui/issues>`__:
   Everything specific to the graphical user interface
- `psy-view <https://github.com/psyplot/psy-view/issues>`__:
  Everything specific to the psy-view graphical user interface
-  `psy-simple <https://github.com/psyplot/psy-simple/issues>`__:
   Everything concerning, e.g. the ``lineplot``, ``plot2d``, ``density``
   or ``vector`` plot methods
-  `psy-maps <https://github.com/psyplot/psy-maps/issues>`__: Everything
   concerning, e.g. the ``mapplot``, ``mapvector`` ``mapcombined`` plot
   methods
-  `psy-reg <https://github.com/psyplot/psy-reg/issues>`__: Everything
   concerning, e.g. the ``linreg`` or ``densityreg`` plot methods
-  `psyplot <https://github.com/psyplot/psyplot/issues>`__: Everything
   concerning the general framework, e.g. data handling, parallel
   update, etc.

Concerning plot methods, you can simply find out which module
implemented it via

.. code:: python

    import psyplot.project as psy
    print(psy.plot.name-of-your-plot-method._plugin)

If you still don’t know, where to open the issue, just go for
`psyplot <https://github.com/psyplot/psyplot/issues>`__.

How Can I Contribute?

Reporting Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for psyplot.
Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community
understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related
reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues and pull
requests as you might find out that you don’t need to create one. When
you are creating a bug report, please `include as many details as
possible <#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report>`__. Fill out `the required
template <https://github.com/psyplot/psyplot/issues/new>`__, the information it asks for
helps us resolve issues faster.

    **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the
    same thing that you’re experiencing, open a new issue and include a
    link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bugs are tracked as `GitHub
issues <https://guides.github.com/features/issues/>`__. After you’ve
determined `which repository <#the-psyplot-framework>`__ your bug is
related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following
information by filling in `the template <https://github.com/psyplot/psyplot/issues/new>`__.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers
reproduce the problem:

-  **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the
   problem.
-  **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many
   details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started
   psyplot, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how
   you started psyplot otherwise. When listing steps, **don’t just say
   what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, did you
   update via GUI or console and what?
-  **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links
   to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you
   use in those examples. If you’re providing snippets in the issue, use
   `Markdown code
   blocks <https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines>`__.
-  **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and
   point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
-  **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
-  **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following
   the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use
   `this tool <https://www.cockos.com/licecap/>`__ to record GIFs on
   macOS and Windows, and `this
   tool <https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast>`__ or `this
   tool <https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz>`__ on Linux.
-  **If the problem is related to your data structure**, include a small
   example how a similar data structure can be generated

Include details about your configuration and environment:

-  **Which version of psyplot are you using?** You can get the exact
   version by running ``psyplot -aV`` in your terminal, or by starting
   the psyplot-gui and open Help->Dependencies.
-  **What’s the name and version of the OS you’re using**?

-  Do not include issue numbers in the PR title
-  Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever

Adding new examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have new examples? Great! If you want to add them to the
documentation, please just fork the correct github repository and add a
jupyter notebook in the `examples <examples>`__ directory, together with
all the necessary data files.

To build our docs, we use the
`sphinx-nbexamples <http://sphinx-nbexamples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
package to convert the examples to reStructuredText. Therefore please
make sure that your supplementary data files are correctly implemented
in the meta data of the notebook.

We are, however, also willing to help you finalizing incomplete pull
requests.

Styleguides
-----------

Git Commit Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Use the present tense (“Add feature” not “Added feature”)
-  Use the imperative mood (“Move cursor to…” not “Moves cursor to…”)
-  Limit the first line (summary) to 72 characters or less
-  Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
-  When only changing documentation, include ``[ci skip]`` in the commit
   title

Documentation Styleguide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Follow the `numpy documentation
   guidelines <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt>`__.

.. code:: python

    @docstrings.get_sections(base='new_function')
    def new_function(a=1):
        """Make some cool new feature

        This function implements a cool new feature
